# Circular Chain (Previously In My Palm)


Circular Chain The continued effect of Climate Change has ushered in a new brand of Consumers who are climate-conscious. They want to know the impact of the product on the environment, the community as well as climate before they can make a purchase.

To attract these consumers, Brands have gone to label their products as eco-friendly, sustainably-produced. Some of these claims are true, but for some are simply greenwashing to fool consumers into buying their products. Unfortunately for consumers, thereâ€™s no way to distinguish sustainably-produced or eco-friendly products from fake ones.

I present to you Circular Chain, A Blockchain-based platform that promotes supply chain transparency and traceability by aggregating data on respective product's impact on the climate, environment as well as community, to come up with a sustainability (esg) score. With Circular Chain, we bring in key sustainability data into consumers hands, where they can simply scan the product's barcode and access its respective sustainability score, and thereby make purchase from brands that share their sustainability values
